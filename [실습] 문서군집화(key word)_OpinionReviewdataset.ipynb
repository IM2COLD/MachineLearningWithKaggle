                             I drive 2 hours to work each day and it is just not comfortable to me .\\n6

.\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                 The seats aren't comfortable either .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                It is relatively comfortable inside .\\n11                                             It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12

                                                                                                                     I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .\\n15

hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

it .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                    Very comfortable, great styling .\\n22                                                                                                                                     I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25

Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?\\n28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an

                             I drive 2 hours to work each day and it is just not comfortable to me .\\n6

.\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                 The seats aren't comfortable either .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                It is relatively comfortable inside .\\n11                                             It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12

                                                                                                                     I've had 3 BMWs and only one of them could offer a more comfortable ride than the Camry .\\n15

hard cheap ones which are very very uncomfortable and give me back pain .\\n17                                                                                                                                             If you keep in mind that the Camry is a comfort car, you may even enjoy the experience .\\n18                                                                                                         While the 4 cylinder does not have the punch of the Honda Accord 4 cylinder, the comfort and quietness of the ride won out .\\n19

it .\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                    Very comfortable, great styling .\\n22                                                                                                                                     I was surprised by how quiet the cabin was and just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25

Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?\\n28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an

does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3

               The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5

                              Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

skipped directions .\\n36

on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39

it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

right to Carmel .\\n45

                                                        The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47

by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

.\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62

speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67

streets .\\n68

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

and Web, based directions .\\n72

                                                                                                                                                                                       Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

     I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .\\n80

Directions unit in my vehicle .\\n81

Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n84

directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .\\n85

for directions .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n87                                                                                                           It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                          After a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on the GPS car navigation wagon .\\n91                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                               I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                               The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"                                                                           Another thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS   .\\n1                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                           it's a curiousity for most of us, traffic and content updates   .\\n3   The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,  Speed of map updates is awesome .\\n5                                                                                                                   I first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                      This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n10                                                                                                                           Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                         The map update  are free for the first 60 days after registering .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The map update was about 2GB in size .\\n13                                                                                                                  I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                              If you don't have a fast Internet connection the update will take some time .\\n15       I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .\\n16

directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

maps .\\n40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road

                                      there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car .\\n1

They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4

pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\\n5

that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Our room rate was all in order \\u0096 we\\u0092d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .\\n11

the beds .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                               I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .\\n13

                                                                                                                                                                                                 Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                              However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

.\\n17                                                                                                                                             room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\\n20                                                                                                                                             Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\u0092s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                              Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26

.\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                       A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\\n28

                                                                                           Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31

.\\n32                                                                                                                                                     Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                       This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41

was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                    Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51

                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53

stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59

free parking .\\n60

had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

                                                       Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71

contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74

about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20

There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

was the wrong order .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                                                  While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n52

                                    Additionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .\\n56

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

                                   More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70

that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71

fraction of the cost .\\n72

back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                            It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

.\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

                                                Headroom body room comfort great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                   It is very quiet and comfortable

                                             For the price I couldn't have asked for a better performing, comfortable and stylish whip .\\n59

              Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64

                                                                                                                                           It is very reliable and comfortable .\\n72

the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

                                The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78

emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

                                                        Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90

of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives

visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99

                                 While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106

comfortable for long trips .\\n108

at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70

mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74

                                                                                         Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage

           Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips

tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

                   Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .\\n53

                          Just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .\\n54

                                                  I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n55

                                                We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\n60                                                                                                                                           Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying \\u00a317 more per night than I'd expected .\\n61

                                    That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us

the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .\\n14

2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101

                                          The rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .\\n102

from a top flight hotel .\\n106                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n108

touched for years .\\n109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n121                                                                                                                                                                                                         The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .\\n122

that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem .\\n123

                       While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .\\n128

areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .\\n104

like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .\\n6                                                                                                                 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .\\n8                                                                                                                  You can't carry an

                                       The problem with Kindle and I expect E, readers is that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .\\n14

on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n29

                          For typing and navigating, the e, ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , ,  especially for frenetic folks in task mode .\\n31   1 the ink takes a moment to display on the screen after your input from the keyboard or navigation contoller  2 the keyboard input is stiff and requires a direct punch on the very tiny keys to register  3 the keyboard is so close to the bottom of the unit, and the Kindle is so flexible, typing is something of a laborious or even tortured action for relatively short notes such as this paragraph actually written on the Kindle 2 .\\n32

Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n33

problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .\\n34

the K1 did not have this either, but it sure would be easier to touch the places you want to navigate than use the joystick .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                                     The fastest way to navigate through a larger work   would be to leave your page, go to the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It's actually slightly more awkward to navigate using the touch screen because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .\\n43

             I find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .\\n44

.\\n13                                                                                                                                                                               The hotel is shaped

Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .\\n96

                      For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99

there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau

                The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114

extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117

hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120

top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n121                                                                                                                                                                                                         The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .\\n122

                                                    While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .\\n128

                                              The location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it

car park is really expensive, so if you are ending a trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .\\n92
